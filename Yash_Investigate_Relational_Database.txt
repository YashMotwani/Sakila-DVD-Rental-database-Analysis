Question 1: We want to understand more about the movies that families are watching. The following categories are considered family movies: Animation, Children, Classics, Comedy, Family and Music.

Create a query that lists each movie, the film category it is classified in, and the number of times it has been rented out

Direction for query formation: For this query, you will need 5 tables: Category, Film_Category, Inventory, Rental and Film. Your solution should have three columns: Film title, Category name and Count of Rentals.

/*Query 1/*
SELECT f.title, c.name, COUNT(r.rental_id)
FROM film_category fc
JOIN category c
ON c.category_id = fc.category_id
JOIN film f
ON f.film_id = fc.film_id
JOIN inventory i
ON i.film_id = f.film_id
JOIN rental r 
ON r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id
WHERE c.name IN ('Animation', 'Children', 'Classics', 'Comedy', 'Family', 'Music')
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 2, 1


Question 2 : Now we need to know how the length of rental duration of these family-friendly movies compares to the duration that all movies are rented for. Can you provide a table with the movie titles 
and divide them into 4 levels (first_quarter, second_quarter, third_quarter, and final_quarter) based on the quartiles (25%, 50%, 75%) of the rental duration for movies across all 
categories? Make sure to also indicate the category that these family-friendly movies fall into.

Direction for query formation: If you correctly split your data. You should only need the category, film_category, and film tables to answer this.

/*Query 2/*
SELECT f.title, c.name, f.rental_duration, NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY f.rental_duration) AS standard_quartile
FROM film_category fc
JOIN category c
ON c.category_id = fc.category_id
JOIN film f
ON f.film_id = fc.film_id
WHERE c.name IN ('Animation', 'Children', 'Classics', 'Comedy', 'Family', 'Music')
ORDER BY 3


Question 3: Finally, provide a table with the family-friendly film category, each of the quartiles, and the corresponding count of movies within each combination of film category for each 
corresponding rental duration category. The resulting table should have three columns:

a. Category
b. Rental length category
c. Count

Direction for query formation: The Count column should be sorted first by Category and then by Rental Duration category.

/*Query 3/*
SELECT t1.name, t1.standard_quartile, COUNT(t1.standard_quartile)
FROM
(SELECT f.title, c.name , f.rental_duration, NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY f.rental_duration) AS standard_quartile
FROM film_category fc
JOIN category c
ON c.category_id = fc.category_id
JOIN film f
ON f.film_id = fc.film_id
WHERE c.name IN ('Animation', 'Children', 'Classics', 'Comedy', 'Family', 'Music')) t1 
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1, 2


Question 4: We would like to know who were our top 10 paying customers, how many payments they made on a monthly basis during 2007, and what was the amount of the monthly payments. Can you write a 
query to capture the customer name, month and year of payment, and total payment amount for each month by these top 10 paying customers?

Direction for query formation: The results are sorted first by customer name and then for each month. Also, total amounts per month will be listed for each customer.

/*Query 4/*
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', p.payment_date) pay_month, c.first_name || ' ' || c.last_name AS full_name, COUNT(p.amount) AS pay_countpermon, SUM(p.amount) AS pay_amount
FROM customer c
JOIN payment p
ON p.customer_id = c.customer_id
WHERE c.first_name || ' ' || c.last_name IN
(SELECT t1.full_name
FROM
(SELECT c.first_name || ' ' || c.last_name AS full_name, SUM(p.amount) as amount_total
FROM customer c
JOIN payment p
ON p.customer_id = c.customer_id
GROUP BY 1	
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 10) t1) AND (p.payment_date BETWEEN '2007-01-01' AND '2008-01-01')
GROUP BY 2, 1
ORDER BY 2, 1, 3
